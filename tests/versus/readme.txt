2 runs from 2 biologically distant genes:
    PCK1 (phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase: neoglucogenesis)
    CHRM1 (muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M1: neuromodulation)

Results' comparison: almost identical.

The edges present in one but not in the other seem to come from immediate (or nearly immediate) regulators, mostly transcription factors >>> relevant and consistent.

The other regulators seem to be distant and irrelevant.

The depth of the searches may be an interesting parameter for:
    increasing relevancy
    decreasing heterogeneity/inconsistency
